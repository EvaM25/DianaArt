    About me
  </h2>
    <p class="about__descr">
      With 6 year of experience as an event illustrator, I have brought over 2500 quick portraits to life. My preferred mediums are watercolor, ink, and markers, which allow me to infuse each sketch with vibrancy and character.
      Beyond live sketches, I have a passion for fashion illustration and offer custom artwork. 
    </p>
    <p class="about__descr">
      My creations are perfect for a range of uses, from advertising campaigns and elegant postcards to invitations, stylish T-shirt designs and  covers.
      Whatever your artistic needs, I'm here to deliver illustrations that stand out.
